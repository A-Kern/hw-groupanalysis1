# hw-groupanalysis1


Generate a table of the significant positive clusters (height threshold p<.001, cluster p <.05) found in a one sample t-test of the Foot-Lips contrast in the **retest** sessions. You can use one-sided test with NN3 connectivity. Use the cluster to run this analysis.

Submit the following as a pull request:

- A single script that accomplishes this, named `scripts/results.sh`
- The resulting table of cluster values, named `results/Foot-Lips.txt`
- A job submission script, named `scripts/sbatch_results.sh`

Do not include any other files in your commit.
